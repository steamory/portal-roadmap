# One Small Step for the Web

> By Sir Tim Berners-Lee

> Iâ€™ve always believed the web is for everyone. That's why I and others fight fiercely to protect it. The changes weâ€™ve managed to bring have created a better and more connected world. But for all the good weâ€™ve achieved, the web has evolved into an engine of inequity and division; swayed by powerful forces who use it for their own agendas.

# Portal Mission Statement

Portal aims to:

1. Ensure that everyone can easily use the power provided by SoLiD through the best user experience.
1. Make technology that promotes individual rights more accessible to the general public.
1. Help drive the next stage of the web - restore rightful ownership of data back to everyone.

Why you'll love Portal:

1. Switch to the best tools and take your data with you.
1. Stop re-entering the same data again and again by recycling data from app to app.
1. Connect to your friends no matter what app they are using.
1. Give access to the bare minimum of data needed for the service to work.

# 2020 Priorities

The most important thing in 2020 is to **ensure that the portal is available before 2020 endsðŸ—½.**

## How to define available

1. Users don't need to know What the Fuck SoLiD is, they can easily understand what the Portal can help users do and what they can accomplish through the interface.
1. Users can have subjective satisfaction after using.

# 2020+ Goals

## Q1: ðŸ—ž PRD

> Comprehensive Product Requirements Documentation to help teams understand the vision and guide developers to turn concepts into reality.

PRD is the foundation. PRD needs to clearly explain the vision, positioning, goals, detailed user interface design diagrams, user operation flowcharts, and risk countermeasures.

## Q1: ðŸ”— Powerful Front-end architecture

> A powerful front-end architecture is used to support complex business processes, allowing developers to extend any feature without restrictions.

Portal's user interface will be very flexible, it will allow users to manage all personal data by writing documents like a sketchpad.
