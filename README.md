# One Small Step for the Web

> By Sir Tim Berners-Lee

> I’ve always believed the web is for everyone. That's why I and others fight fiercely to protect it. The changes we’ve managed to bring have created a better and more connected world. But for all the good we’ve achieved, the web has evolved into an engine of inequity and division; swayed by powerful forces who use it for their own agendas.

# Portal Mission Statement

Portal aims to:

1. Ensure that everyone can easily use the power provided by SoLiD through the best user experience.
1. Make technology that promotes individual rights more accessible to the general public.
1. Help drive the next stage of the web - restore rightful ownership of data back to everyone.

Why you'll love Portal:

1. Switch to the best tools and take your data with you.
1. Stop re-entering the same data again and again by recycling data from app to app.
1. Connect to your friends no matter what app they are using.
1. Give access to the bare minimum of data needed for the service to work.

# 2020 Priorities

The most important thing in 2020 is to **ensure that the portal is available before 2020 ends🗽.**

## How to define available

1. Users don't need to know What the Fuck SoLiD is, they can easily understand what the Portal can help users do and what they can accomplish through the interface.
1. Users can have subjective satisfaction after using.

# 2020+ Goals

## Q1: 🗞 PRD

> Comprehensive Product Requirements Documentation to help teams understand the vision and guide developers to turn concepts into reality.

PRD is the foundation. PRD needs to clearly explain the vision, positioning, goals, detailed user interface design diagrams, user operation flowcharts, and risk countermeasures.

## Q1: 🔗 Powerful Front-end architecture

> A powerful front-end architecture is used to support complex business processes, allowing developers to extend any feature without restrictions.

Portal's user interface will be very flexible, it will allow users to manage all personal data by writing documents like a sketchpad.

## Q1: 👨‍💻 User

> User can login in Portal via SoLiD WebId and edit their profile.

Login with WebID to use Solid. Similar to email, WebID allows users to connect to anyone else no matter who their identity provider is. When users login with WebID, users and only users and where users are signing into knows about it.

## Q2: 🗄 Unstructured data manager

> Users can manage unstructured data such as music, file, photos, documents and so on.

Users' Pod is where users store their data. Pods and apps are always separate and compatible meaning you are free to pick and choose and change users mind while still keeping users' data. For example, if you want to switch messaging app you can take users contacts and chat history along easily.

## Q3: 📖 Flexible user interface infrastructure

> A flexible, real-time user interface infrastructure allows users to manage any data.

No more ping-ponging between niche workflow apps to get things done. Portal brings all of your words and data into one flexible surface.

With Portal, everything users do is finally in one place and can be just as unique as they are.

## Q4: Portal Templates

> Turn users' real-life into portal templates.

Portal Templates is the way people manage their data, If a user has a good template to manage their data, it can share it with anyone.

## Q4: 🔭 Website

> Our home to announce something excited.
